# Deep Q Learning
Deep Q Learning - Convolutional neural network  
Used libraries : Theano - Keras for GPU calculations and Numpy.

This project is about teaching computer to play game without having any preknowledge about the game (learn from raw pixels). In this sample experience, the computer control a red panel which can move left and right try to avoid collision with other black bricks which are falling from the sky. Given only images of the game and the reward the agent gets after each move he chose, the agent must learn a strategy to survive as long as possible.

Algorithm : Deep Q learning using convolutional neural network.
